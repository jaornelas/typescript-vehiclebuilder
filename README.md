# TypeScript- Vehicle Builder
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
This is an interactive program that allows a user to either create a new vehicle, or select from an existing vehicle. After the vehicle is selected, users are able to perform various actions and tell the console what to do. It is important to START the vehicle before you accelerate/decelerate, and also STOPPING the vehicle will automatically bring it to 0 mph. Trucks will have the capability to tow, and Motorbikes will be able to do wheelies!
